## Final Evaluation

The project demonstrates the complete process of designing, configuring, securing, and testing a small business network in the Cisco Packet Tracer simulator. We have included essential features based on CCNA I that are suitable for the project and are key to building a functional and secure network for the chosen topic/model.

From the initial topology through detailed addressing, VLAN segmentation, and routing, to NAT/PAT and DNS services, a fully operational network infrastructure was built for a small café business.  
Security features such as Port Security, ACLs, and shutting down unused ports were implemented to ensure resilience against common local threats.  
Continuous testing and troubleshooting confirmed that the configuration meets the defined objectives and can serve as a complete reference model for both educational and practical use.



## Project Summary in Points

- **Chapter 1:** Network topology design with a central router (R1), an edge router (R2), and a server simulating internet services. Includes hardware description and physical connections.
    
- **Chapter 2:** Addressing and VLAN planning -> static IP addressing, division into VLANs 10–40, preparation for Router-on-a-Stick.
    
- **Chapter 3:** Basic configuration -> device naming, static IP address assignment on routers and PCs, and interconnection between R1 and R2.
    
- **Chapter 4:** VLAN and subinterface configuration -> VLAN creation, port assignments, trunk setup, subinterface configuration on R1, and verification of inter-VLAN connectivity.
    
- **Chapter 5:** NAT and PAT -> static routing between R1 and R2, configuration of NAT/PAT on R1 for outbound VLAN traffic via a single public IP address.
    
- **Chapter 6:** Internet and DNS -> connection to a DNS/HTTP server, creation of DNS records, verification of domain name resolution, and loading of a test webpage.
    
- **Chapter 7:** Network security -> password and user account setup, warning banners, Telnet security, Port Security, disabling unused ports, and ACLs for controlling communication between VLANs.
    
- **Chapter 8:** Connectivity testing -> verification of router interconnection, VLAN communication, NAT/PAT functionality, DNS/HTTP availability, and enforcement of security measures.
    
- **Chapter 9:** Troubleshooting -> resolution of three error scenarios (incorrect VLAN ID, NAT/PAT on the wrong interface, ACL rule order issues), including diagnostics, fixes, and validation.
