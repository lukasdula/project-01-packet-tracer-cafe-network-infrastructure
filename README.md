# Project Café Network Infrastructure

This is my first network project - a small café network infrastructure created in Cisco Packet Tracer.

The project was developed as part of my preparation for **CCNA I: Introduction to Networks**.


## Documentation
The documentation is available in two languages:

- [English version](en/README.en.md)  
- [Czech version](cz/README.cs.md)
